                      Having using Evercam services at the NEW Children

                      an excellent customer care. Amazing team of professionals

                      The real power of Evercam is the ability to integrate the
                      BIM model…This allowed our client to get a feel for what
                      the finished office would look like and gave the ability
                      to track progress against the final product.

                      like the sense of flexibility that Evercam has with their

                      Evercam provided a good project specification and worked
                      within a tight timeframe to get the project up and
